        <h3 id="thirteen">What is web development:-</h3>
        <p class="fourteen">Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications, encompassing everything from designing the layout to coding the functionality. It involves using various programming languages and tools to bring a website or web application to life, and can also include tasks like content creation and project management. Web development is broadly divided into front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development.</p></div>
        <div class="sixteen">
        <h4 id="fifteen">What you have to learn for a web developer?</h4>
        <p>To become a web developer, you'll need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the foundation of web development. Additionally, understanding version control (like Git) and having a basic understanding of SEO principles are crucial. For backend development, you may want to learn a server-side language like Python or Java.</p>

                <h4 style="color: rgb(18, 243, 18);"> Not Everyone is a Planner</h4>
                <p>And that's OK! Mark is definitely not a planner. That's probably because he knows that I am üòä. However, he never wants to know what I have planned. He would rather me tell him what's happening a day or two before (or even on the morning!). He enjoys the sense of surprise. He loves that I have done all the research about where we are going and that I can share this information at just the right time. This wouldn't do for me at all! I'm sure this is one of the reasons why we travel so well together!</p>
                
               <p> If you are more like Mark, but don't have someone like me to do the planning for you, don't worry! I suggest that you still need a basic travel plan, even if only to ensure you don't get stuck somewhere without the wherewithal to get out of the situation. But, and here's the good bit there are plenty of resources available to help you.</p>
                
                <p>Whether you are a Mark or an Andrea when it comes to trip planning, this guide will help youüòä.</p>

                <h2 style="color: goldenrod;">Histry Of Cox Bazar:-</h2>
                <p>Cox's Bazar; Bengali: ‡¶ï‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∏‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∞, romanized: K√¥ksbƒÅjƒÅr; pronounced [k…îksbad ía…æ] is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in south-eastern Bangladesh. Cox's Bazar Beach, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangladesh, is the longest uninterrupted naturally occurring sea beach in the world.[1][2] Located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." An old name was "Palongkee".[3][4]</p>
    
                    <p>The city covers an area of 23.4 km2 (9.0 sq mi) with 58 mahallas and 27 wards and as of 2022 had a population of nearly 200,000.[5] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.[6][7]</p>
                    
                    <p>The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him. It is one of Bangladesh's main tourist spots. In 2023 Bangladesh evacuated over 50,000 people in Cox's Bazar to safe shelters as Cyclone Mocha approached.[8] During the protest of 2024, around 10,000 tourists were stuck in Cox's Bazar, who were later transported by plane and army patrol.[9]</p>

                <h2 style="color: goldenrod;">Histry Of Sent Martin:-</h2>
                <p>St. Martin's Island, a coral island off the coast of Bangladesh, has a history rooted in geological processes and human settlement. It was once part of the Teknaf peninsula, but became separated due to coastal changes. Arabian merchants settled the island in the 18th century, naming it "Jazira". During British rule, it was renamed St. Martin's Island after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong, Mr. Martin. </p>
